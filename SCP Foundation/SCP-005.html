        <p>
          SCP-005 poses no immediate risk in any direct sense. Even so, its
          unique functions require special measures be taken to restrict access
          and manipulation of the object. Approval of at least one (1) Level 4
          personnel is required for the removal of the object from its
          containment area.

        <h3>Description:</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="SCP-txt">
        <p>
          In appearance, SCP-005 resembles an ornate key, displaying the
          characteristics of a typical mass produced key used in the 1920s. The
          key was discovered when a civilian used it to infiltrate a high
          security facility. SCP-005 seems to have the unique ability to open
          any and all forms of lock (See Appendix A), be they mechanical or
          digital, with relative ease. The origin of this ability has yet to be
          determined.

        <h3>Additional Notes:</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="SCP-txt">
        <p>
          SCP-005 may be used as a replacement for lost security passes, but
          only under the supervision of at least one (1) Level 4 personnel.
          SCP-005 may not be used for vending machine repairs, opening lockers,
          or for any personnel's spare home key. Removal of the object from the
          compound will result in immediate termination.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sub-headings">
        <h3>Appendix A:</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="SCP-txt">
        <p>
          While SCP-005 has been shown to be effective in removing almost any
          form of locking device, further experiments have shown that efforts to
          disguise the purpose or identity of a lock have proven at least
          somewhat successful in defeating SCP-005's ability. In approximately
          50% of cases where a volunteer was not able to identify a locking
          device as such, SCP-005 was not successful in deactivating the device.
          Due to these results, SCP-005 has been tentatively classified as
          'sentient' and further tests are being run to determine its cognitive
          abilities. However, there are no results that show any traits that
          prevent it from being able to identify any particular locking device,
          only that the aforementioned device has been heavily concealed and
          disguised.
